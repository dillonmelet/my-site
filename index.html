    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>5 years ago I moved to Israel with the dream of being able to live in a country where I didn't know anybody, had trouble understanding the culture, and didn't even speak the language. If there's one thing that these past years have taught me it's the importance of humility and resourcefulness. These are qualities I bring to my career, copywriting, one that relies on customer responses to your creativity, and not your subjective opinion. This, and combining my love for understanding people around the world has helped me to turn this passion into a money-making opportunity not only for myself, but for those brilliant people I am fortunate enough to work with.</p>
